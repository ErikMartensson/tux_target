> A free multiplayer online action game where you roll down a giant ramp and delicately land on platforms to score points. Fight with and against players in this mix of action, dexterity, and strategy - inspired by Monkey Target from Super Monkey Ball.

**Status:** ✅ Playable - Version 1.2.2a client and server fully functional

## About This Project

**MTP Target** was created by Melting Pot in 2003-2004 and went offline around 2013. This is a community effort to bring it back to life by:

1. ✅ **Building a local server** - Run your own game server
2. ✅ **Creating a modern login service** - TypeScript/Deno replacement for authentication
3. ✅ **Compiling the client** - Build from source for debugging and modifications
4. ✅ **Windows support** - Full Windows build with Visual Studio 2022

### Version Strategy

We're currently running **version 1.2.2a** (from this repository's source code) for both client and server. This ensures full compatibility between all components.

**Future Plans:**
- Port features and improvements from version 1.5.19 where possible
- Add additional levels from 1.5.19 release
- Consider protocol upgrade to 1.5.19 if compatible with gameplay

The original v1.5.19 server source is unavailable, so we're starting with the v1.2.2a codebase we have and will enhance it over time.

---

## Current Status

### What Works ✅

- ✅ **Game Server:** Fully functional on Windows, 69 levels loaded
- ✅ **Game Client:** Fully functional on Windows with OpenGL/OpenAL drivers
- ✅ **Login Service:** Modern TypeScript implementation handles authentication
- ✅ **Database:** SQLite-based user and shard management
- ✅ **Physics:** ODE 0.16.5 engine with Lua 5.x scripting
- ✅ **Network:** Full protocol working (VLP login + game server connection)
- ✅ **Gameplay:** Keyboard controls, bot AI, level transitions, scoring
- ✅ **Graphics:** NeL 3D rendering with skybox, models, particles
- ✅ **Sound:** OpenAL audio system

### Known Issues ⚠️

- ⚠️ **Water rendering disabled** - Missing texture files cause crash
- ⚠️ **Penguin models overlapping** - Scale/positioning issue (doesn't prevent gameplay)
- ⚠️ **Limited to v1.2.2a features** - Some v1.5.19 improvements not yet ported

See [docs/RUNTIME_FIXES.md](docs/RUNTIME_FIXES.md) for detailed issue documentation.

## Quick Start (Windows)

**Prerequisites:**
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools
- CMake 3.20+
- Deno 2.6.0+ (for login service)
- Git Bash (recommended for running scripts)

### 1. Build Dependencies

See **[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md)** for complete instructions on building:
- NeL Framework (from Ryzom Core)
- ODE Physics Library (0.16.5)
- External dependencies (CURL, Lua, libxml2, etc.)

### 2. Build Game Client & Server

```bash
cd tux_target
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure
cmake .. -DBUILD_CLIENT=ON -DBUILD_SERVER=ON \
  -DWITH_STATIC=ON -DWITH_STATIC_LIBXML2=ON -DWITH_STATIC_CURL=ON

# Build
cmake --build . --config Release -j 24

# Run post-build setup
cd ..
./scripts/post_build.sh  # or scripts\post_build.bat on Windows
```

### 3. Start Services

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start login service
cd login-service-deno
deno task login

# Terminal 2: Start game server
cd build/bin/Release
./tux-target-srv.exe

# Terminal 3: Start game client
cd build/bin/Release
./tux-target.exe
```

**Controls:**
- **Arrow keys:** Steer penguin (requires speed in ball mode)
- **CTRL:** Toggle between ball/gliding modes
- **Enter:** Open chat (press again to send)
- **Escape:** Cancel chat

For detailed build instructions and troubleshooting, see **[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md)** and **[docs/RUNTIME_FIXES.md](docs/RUNTIME_FIXES.md)**.

## What We've Fixed

The original code was from 2003-2004 and needed updates for modern systems:

- ✅ **Lua 5.0 → 5.1** - Migrated to currently supported Lua version
- ✅ **64-bit compatibility** - Fixed pointer casts and size types
- ✅ **Modern NeL API** - Updated for RyzomCore (NeL's successor)
- ✅ **ODE 0.5 → 0.16** - Physics engine upgrade
- ✅ **Namespace fixes** - Resolved conflicts with modern C++ std library

See [docs/MODIFICATIONS.md](docs/MODIFICATIONS.md) for technical details.
