# Changelog

All notable improvements and changes from the original MTP Target v1.2.2a.

## Client Improvements

### Options Menu (New)
In-game options accessible from both main menu and pause menu:
- **Resolution selection** - Cycle through available display modes (left-click forward, right-click backward)
- **Fullscreen toggle** - Switch between windowed and fullscreen modes
- **VSync toggle** - Enable/disable vertical sync
- **Music volume slider** - Adjust background music volume (0-100%)
- **Sound volume slider** - Adjust sound effects volume (0-100%)
- Volume changes apply immediately without restart
- Video settings from main menu auto-restart the game when Apply is clicked
- Video settings from pause menu require manual restart (to avoid disconnecting from server)

### Pause Menu (New)
Press **Escape** during gameplay to access the pause menu:
- **Resume** - Return to gameplay
- **Options** - Access video and audio settings mid-game
- **Disconnect** - Return to main menu (cleanly disconnects from server)
- **Quit Game** - Exit the application

### Disconnect/Reconnect Flow (Fixed)
- Fixed crashes when disconnecting and reconnecting to servers
- Proper cleanup of game tasks, entities, and GUI elements
- Error dialogs now have OK button and can be dismissed with Escape key

### Aspect Ratio Fix
- Fixed stretched display on widescreen monitors (16:9, 21:9, etc.)
- Game was originally designed for 4:3 and hardcoded `1.33f` aspect ratio
- Camera perspective now calculates aspect ratio from actual screen dimensions
- Main menu background, logo, and dartboard now scale correctly without stretching

### Sound Effects (Fixed)
All game sound effects now working:
- **Countdown sounds** (0-5) - Play during session countdown
- **Open sound** - Plays when transitioning to fly mode (wings open)
- **Close sound** - Plays when transitioning to ball mode (wings close)
- **Impact sound** - Plays when crashing while flying
- **Splash sound** - Plays when entering water (client-side detection)

Sound features:
- **Distance-based volume** - Other players' sounds attenuate with distance
- **User volume scaling** - All sounds respect the Sound Volume slider
- **Local player priority** - Your own sounds always play at full volume

### HUD Speed Display
- Added speedometer to bottom-right corner of HUD (above score)
- Shows current speed as an integer value (scaled x100 for readability)
- Color-coded acceleration feedback:
  - **Green** - Accelerating
  - **Red** - Decelerating
  - **White** - Stable speed
- Uses dual exponential moving average (EMA) for smooth display

### Keyboard Controls Fix
- Fixed arrow keys being captured by chat input during gameplay
- Implemented chat toggle mode:
  - Press **Enter** to activate chat input
  - Type message and press **Enter** to send
  - Arrow keys now properly control penguin steering during gameplay

### Command-Line Arguments
- `--lan <host>` - Auto-connect to a LAN server
- `--user <name>` - Set player name for auto-connect
- Example: `tux-target.exe --lan localhost --user Player1`

### Right-Click Support
- Added right-click detection to GUI button system
- Used for cycling backwards through resolution options

## Physics Improvements

### Momentum Preservation
- Fixed momentum loss at ramp transitions
- Changed ODE contact mode from `dContactMu2` to `dContactApprox1` in physics.cpp
- Players now maintain speed when transitioning between surfaces

### Slope Steering
- Fixed inability to steer or accelerate on starting slopes
- Solution: Add explicit properties to slope modules:
  ```lua
  { Lua="snow_ramp", Friction = 0, Bounce = 0, Accel = 0.0001 }
  ```

## Server Improvements

### Level System
- All 32 playable snow/antarctic theme levels working
- All 4 team levels working with proper scoring
- Score/Friction/Accel/Bounce properties loaded from level Lua files
- Lua 5.2+ compatibility for module scripts

### Configuration
- `LevelPlaylist` config option for testing specific levels
- Network tick rate increased from 25Hz to 50Hz

## Build System

### Windows Build
- CMake 3.5+ compatibility
- MySQL made optional (login service uses SQLite)
- Fixed library linking order and dependencies
- Added build scripts: `scripts/build-client.bat`, `scripts/build-server.bat`
- Post-build script copies data files to build directories

### Source Modernization
- Lua 5.0 to 5.x compatibility layer (`common/lua_compat.h`)
- Updated NeL API calls for modern Ryzom Core
- Fixed C++11 compatibility issues (NL_I64 literal spacing)
- Added NLMISC namespace qualifiers where needed
